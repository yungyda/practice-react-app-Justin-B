# React Profile Card App

A simple and modular React application that renders user profile cards dynamically using props and functional components. This project demonstrates component reusability, dynamic rendering with props, and clean separation of concerns in a React-based frontend.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔁 **Reusable Components** — `ProfileCard` is a standalone component that can accept and render any profile data passed via props.
- 📦 **Component Composition** — `ProfileContainer` manages and renders multiple `ProfileCard` components.
- 🧠 **Dynamic Rendering** — The app uses JavaScript's `.map()` method to dynamically generate UI elements from an array of data.
- 🎨 **Responsive Styling** — The layout is styled using Flexbox for clean alignment and modern presentation.

## 🚀 Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast dev server and bundling
- CSS (vanilla) for layout and styling
